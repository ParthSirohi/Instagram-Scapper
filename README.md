# Instagram-Scapper
This is a Instagram scapper that collects the number of likes, comments, and post IDs (Instagram doesn't provide share counts via the API) and saves this data into a CSV file.
Please replace 'example_handle' with the actual Instagram handle you wish to scrape. Note that Instagram's API and Instaloader limitations may affect the type and amount of data you can 
scrape, especially for private accounts or without proper authentication. 
Always adhere to ethical guidelines and Instagram's terms of service when performing such operations.

It is crucial to consider the ethical implications of data mining, especially when it involves social media platforms like Instagram.

 Ethical Considerations:
 1. Respect Privacy: Ensure that you're not infringing on individuals' privacy. Avoid scraping private accounts or using data to invade personal privacy.
 2. Adhere to Legal Regulations: Be aware of and comply with legal regulations, including data protection laws like GDPR.
 3. Transparency: Be transparent about your data collection methods and purposes.
 4. Do Not Harm: Ensure your data collection and analysis methods do not harm individuals or communities.

 Remember, while tools like Instaloader can scrape public data from Instagram, it's essential to use the data responsibly and ethically.
